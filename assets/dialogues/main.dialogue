Ethan: This... this can’t be Lumaria. The skies, the trees... everything’s wrong. What happened here? Where is everyone?

Elder: You’ve returned, Ethan. I feared you might not recognize your home.

Ethan: Home? This isn’t my home. It’s a nightmare! The fields were golden, the rivers clear, the air filled with music. Now… it’s all rot and shadows. Elder, please, tell me what happened.

Elder: It began not long after you left, Ethan. The Veil—the barrier that shielded Lumaria from the world beyond—was breached. We thought it was a mere tear, something the Guardians could mend. But we were wrong.

Ethan: The Veil? Breached? How? Who could have done this?

Elder: Not who, child, but what. From beyond the Veil came the Corruption. A force of darkness that twists all it touches—our lands, our people, even our light. At first, we fought it, but...

Ethan: But what? You didn’t give up, did you? Lumaria is strong!

Elder: Strength alone is not enough against a foe you cannot touch or reason with. The Corruption seeps into hearts, feeds on fear and despair. One by one, our Guardians fell. Even the great Ardan—your mentor—succumbed.

Ethan: Ardan... no. He was the strongest of us all. If even he— [pauses, regaining composure] No. I won’t believe that this is the end. There must be something we can do.

Elder: There is... perhaps. Before the Corruption consumed him, Ardan entrusted me with a fragment of Lumaria’s light. It is weak, but it still shines. If you can rekindle it, there may be a chance to push back the darkness.

Ethan: Tell me how. Whatever it takes, I’ll do it.

Elder: (reaches into his robe and pulls out a small crystal, glowing faintly) This shard is bound to the Heart of Lumaria, the source of our light. You must journey to the ruins of the Heart and restore its connection to the land. But beware, Ethan. The Corruption will not let you pass easily.

Ethan: (taking the crystal carefully, his eyes burning with resolve) I’m not afraid. This is my home. I’ll fight for it, for the people, for Ardan.

Elder: (gazes at him with a mixture of pride and sorrow) You carry the last hope of Lumaria, Ethan. Walk with courage, and may the light guide your way.

Ethan: (standing tall, his voice unwavering) I’ll bring the light back, Elder. I swear it.
